# Performance Overlay

The game screen shows a performance overlay, visible by default in every build. Press F3 to toggle it. Values refresh once per second of real time (unaffected by game speed). The sample is discarded while the game is paused and after a real gap longer than 1s between frames (background tab, sleep).

- FPS: 60 — Frames per second. How many times the requestAnimationFrame loop ran in the last second. 60 = smooth on a 60 Hz display, drops mean the browser is struggling to keep up.
- Frame: 16.6ms — Average real time between rAF frames in milliseconds. It follows the display refresh rate (~16.6ms at 60 Hz, ~6.9ms at 144 Hz) whatever the load, so it does not show headroom within a frame. It only rises above the refresh interval when frames are dropped.
- syncUI: 0.2ms — Average time spent in syncUI(), the full sync that copies all game state into the ui reactive object. Timed on every 1s game tick, and on rAF frames right after a background-tab catch-up, a construction/HQ upgrade/research completion, a blessing expiring, or the game pausing. Untimed calls (game mount, blessing pick, punishment, win, tutorial dismiss) are not counted. This is the main thing your optimizations target.
- syncTimers: 0.03ms — Average time spent in syncTimers(), the fast-path sync that only updates time-sensitive fields (season elapsed, season/year, construction and HQ upgrade timers, research timers, event countdowns). Runs on rAF frames that don't need a full sync, throttled to once every 50ms (~20 times per second). Should be much cheaper than syncUI.
- tick: 0.1ms — Average time of the 1s game tick's simulation: one or more state.update() steps of at most 5 game seconds (each followed by a tutorial check), plus progress timers when the tab is hidden or the rAF loop fell behind. Catch-ups run from the rAF loop are not counted. Excludes UI sync.
- Heap: 45 MB / 4 GB — Used / limit JS heap size. Only shown in browsers that expose `performance.memory` (Chromium-based).
